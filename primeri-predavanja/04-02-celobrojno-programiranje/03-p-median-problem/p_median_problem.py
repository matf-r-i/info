# Facility location problem can be described terms as follows:
# We must decide the placement of a group of facilities that distribute a certain good to a group of consumers that need it.
# The placement must to be chosen in order to minimize the distribution costs and fulfilling a set of possible additional constraints like building budget or maximum number of facilities.
# In a first stage, letâ€™s make the following assumptions:
# 1. The possible locations for the facilities are known.
# 2. The facility building costs are fixed and known. This cost is paid only if we decide that the facility is going to be installed.
# 3. The transportation costs are known. For example we can imagine that the transport cost is proportional to the total distance covered in the good distribution.
# 4. Each facility can, if necessary, provide the all the demand.
# Notice that in this scenario there are two possible decision to be maid:
# (1) which facilities will be built and
# (2) which facility will serve each consumer.
# The objective of this assignment is to find an optimal placement of the facilities by formulating the problem as a Mixed Linear Integer Programming problem.
